# 👋 Hi, I’m Peter

I’m a Data Engineer with a background in analytics and a and a growing focus on real-time pipelines and scalable architecture. I enjoy working with Python, SQL, and any tools that allow me to learn something new and do some problem-solving.

## 🔧 What I’ve Been Working On

- **Threat Ingestion Pipeline** – End-to-end data pipeline using Kafka, Airflow, and dbt for threat intelligence enrichment.
- **pi-carbon-energy-meter** – IoT project using Raspberry Pi and Espruino to track electricity usage and estimate CO₂ emissions.
- **BikeTorqueSpecifications** – A centralised web resource for bike bolt torque settings (because details matter).
- **Flutter Apps** – Exploring mobile development with interval timers, chat apps, and quizzes.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- Event-driven architectures and real-time analytics
- Cloud tooling: Azure Synapse, Data Factory, Delta Lake
- French phrases for travel (and croissants 🥐)

## 📸 Outside of Tech

Photography, Travel, Hiking, and Mountain Biking

## 📫 Let’s Connect

I’m open to roles that combine **innovation**, **collaboration**, and **impact**—especially if they involve a strong mission and a social team. You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterduebel/).
